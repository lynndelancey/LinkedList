# CustomLinkedList

This project implements a custom singly linked list in Java with support for:

- Insertion of nodes
- Deletion of nodes by value
- Traversal using a custom iterator

## Features

- Inner `Node` class for list structure
- Inner `LinkedListIterator` class for traversal
- File input support for bulk data insertion

## How to Run

1. Place your integer data in `input.txt`
2. Compile and run `Main.java`
3. Observe list operations and iterator output
